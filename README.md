# Portfolio Website

This repository includes all files necessary to build and run my portfolio website. 
I am developing with Visual Studio, Node.js, Vite, and React.
I started this project to fulfill multiple needs:

1. Showing physical proof of my skills to employers
2. Finding a way to easily organize all my work from college
3. Practicing and improving on my website development skills

## Current State

Currently, I am pursuing a minimum viable product. 
This means mostly static webpages and possibly some disorganized code.

## Current Focus

This project is also mean to be my reintroduction to React, so I am reworking my existing code that I sort of brute forced together.
This involves removing unnecessary complexity in file structure, styles, and components themselves - in hopes that these reworks make implementing interactive components easier.

## Next Steps

To reach MVP, I must finish a first implementation for:

- [x] Home Page
- [x] Projects Browser
- [ ] Updates Browser
- [ ] About Page

## Future Improvements

I plan to make this an interactive and professional UI design portfolio.
This means I need to do more research on State in React, as well as animating UI elements.
